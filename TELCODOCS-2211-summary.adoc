= TELCODOCS-2211: Docs and RN: 3 Card WPC T-GM

== Summary
This document outlines the updates required for configuring linuxptp services as a grandmaster clock (T-GM) for 3 Card WPC. The current documentation only addresses dual card configurations, and this update aims to make the section more generic by including examples for both 2 NIC and 3 NIC setups.

== Key Updates

1. **Rewording**:
   - Update the section to state: "You can configure the `linuxptp` services as a T-GM for the following cards."

2. **Table Update**:
   - Remove class 140 from the table in the [PTP Grandmaster Clock Class Reference](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/networking/ptp/configuring-ptp.html#nw-ptp-grandmaster-clock-class-reference_configuring-ptp).

3. **Example Configuration**:
   - Provide an example PTP configuration. Drafts are available in [CNF-16811](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/CNF-16811).

4. **Diagram**:
   - Include a diagram to illustrate multiple connection options.
